### Companion web app for Wordle/Lewdle/Absurdle/Dordle

Have this site open in a separate tab and as you play the actual game, enter the same words here, click the letters to cycle through colors until they match the colors/states of the letters in the game, and then click the update button to get a list of valid words for your next guess.
